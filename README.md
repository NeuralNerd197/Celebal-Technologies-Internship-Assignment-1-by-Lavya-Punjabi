Assignment 1: Celebal Technologies Internship - 6-Day Power BI Challenge
This repository contains my solutions for Assignment 1 of the Celebal Technologies Power BI Internship. This assignment was a comprehensive 6-day challenge, with each day focusing on specific data analytics concepts and tasks, primarily utilizing Power BI.

Repository Structure
The repository is organized to clearly delineate each day's assignment:

Day 1, 6(Part 1)/: Contains files related to Day 1 and the Day 6 (Cement Company Analysis) assignments.
Day 2/: Contains files related to Day 2's assignment.
Day 3, 4, 5/: Contains files related to the Day 3, Day 4, and Day 5 assignments.
Day 6(Part 2)/: Contains files related to the Day 6 (Covid Dataset Analysis) assignment.
Explainatory Video(Must Watch)/: This directory contains a single, integrated video that provides a walk-through and explanation for each day's assignment. Please watch this video first before exploring the individual day's dashboards or code.
Important Note: Watch the Explanatory Video First!
To get the most comprehensive understanding of my work, I strongly recommend watching the explanatory video located in the Explainatory Video(Must Watch)/ directory before reviewing the individual day's content or dashboards.

This video serves as a guided tour through each day's assignment, explaining:

The problem statement and objectives for each day.
The methodologies and approaches used.
Key insights derived from the analysis.
Demonstrations of the results and any interactive elements within the dashboards.
Watching the video first will provide crucial context and insights that might not be immediately apparent from just reviewing the dashboards or underlying files alone.

How to Navigate This Repository
Watch the Explanatory Video: Start by watching the video file within the Explainatory Video(Must Watch)/ directory.
Explore by Day: After watching the video, you can dive into specific days by navigating to their respective directories (e.g., Day 1, 6(Part 1)/, Day 2/, etc.).
Review Dashboards and Files: Each day's directory will contain the relevant Power BI files (.pbix), any supporting data files, and potentially screenshots or descriptions of the dashboards.
Technologies Used
Power BI
