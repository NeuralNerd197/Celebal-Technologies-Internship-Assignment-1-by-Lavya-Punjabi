Assignment 1: Celebal Technologies Internship - 6-Day Data Science Challenge
This repository contains my solutions for Assignment 1 of the Celebal Technologies Power BI Internship. This assignment was a comprehensive 6-day challenge, with each day focusing on specific data analytics concepts and tasks.

Repository Structure
The repository is organized to clearly delineate each day's assignment:

Day 1, 6(Part 1)/: Contains files related to Day 1 and Day 6(Cement Company Analysis) assignment.
Day 2/: Contains files related to Day 2's assignment.
Day 3, 4, 5/: Contains files related to Day 3, Day 4, Day 5 assignment.
Day 6(Part 2)//: Contains files related to Day 6's Covid Dataset Analysis assignment.
Explainatory Video(Must Watch)/: This directory contains a single, integrated video that provides a walk-through and explanation for each day's assignment. Please watch this video first before exploring the individual day's dashboards or code.
Important Note: Watch the Explainatory Video First!
To get the most comprehensive understanding of my work, I strongly recommend watching the Explainatory video located in the Day 2/Explainatory video(Must Watch)/ directory before reviewing the individual day's content or dashboards.

This video serves as a guided tour through each day's assignment, explaining:

The problem statement and objectives for each day.
The methodologies and approaches used.
Key insights derived.
Demonstrations of the results and any interactive elements.
Watching the video first will provide crucial context and insights that might not be immediately apparent from just reviewing the code or dashboards alone.
